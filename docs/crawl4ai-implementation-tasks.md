### Phase 2: Testing and Validation (Priority: Medium)

#### Task 2.1: Unit Testing
**File**: Create test files if needed
**Objective**: Verify native deep crawling works correctly
**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes

**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Test with simple website (e.g., documentation site)
- [ ] Test with complex website (e.g., e-commerce site)
- [ ] Test error handling and fallback mechanism
- [ ] Compare results: native vs manual implementation

**Test Criteria:**
- Native method returns multiple pages
- Results are properly formatted
- Error handling works correctly
- Performance is improved vs manual method

---

#### Task 2.2: Azure Integration Testing
**File**: Test against Azure Container App
**Objective**: Ensure native deep crawling works with Azure backend
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Test connection to Azure Crawl4AI service
- [ ] Verify deep crawling API endpoint availability
- [ ] Test with real URLs and monitor Azure logs
- [ ] Validate response processing

**Test Criteria:**
- Successfully connects to Azure service
- Deep crawling requests complete successfully
- Results are saved to database correctly
- No Azure service errors or timeouts

---

#### Task 2.3: Performance Comparison
**File**: Document results
**Objective**: Compare performance of native vs manual approach
**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes

**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Measure time: native vs manual smart crawl
- [ ] Count API requests: native vs manual
- [ ] Compare result quality and completeness
- [ ] Document findings

**Test Criteria:**
- Native method is faster than manual
- Native method uses fewer API requests
- Result quality is equal or better

---

### Phase 3: Optimization and Cleanup (Priority: Low)

#### Task 3.1: Remove Manual Implementation (Optional)
**File**: `/src/services/crawl4ai.ts`
**Objective**: Clean up code after successful native implementation
**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes

**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Remove manual URL discovery methods (if native works reliably)
- [ ] Remove manual batching logic
- [ ] Simplify smart crawl method
- [ ] Update comments and documentation

**Test Criteria:**
- Code is cleaner and more maintainable
- All functionality still works
- No breaking changes introduced

---

#### Task 3.2: Configuration Optimization
**File**: `/src/services/crawl4ai.ts`
**Objective**: Fine-tune deep crawling parameters based on testing
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Adjust max_depth based on test results
- [ ] Optimize max_pages for different use cases
- [ ] Fine-tune filtering rules
- [ ] Update URL scoring parameters

**Test Criteria:**
- Parameters are optimized for typical use cases
- Configuration is documented

- [ ] Improve fallback logic
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running crawls
- [ ] Update user-facing error messages

## Testing Protocol

### Before Each Phase
1. **Backup Current Implementation**: Create git branch
2. **Document Current Behavior**: Record how manual smart crawl currently works
3. **Set Success Criteria**: Define what constitutes successful completion

### After Each Task
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify the specific functionality works
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensure no existing functionality is broken
3. **Performance Testing**: Measure any performance impacts
4. **User Testing**: Verify user experience is maintained or improved

### Rollback Plan
- Keep manual implementation as fallback during Phase 1 & 2
- Maintain git branches for easy rollback
- Document any issues encountered for future reference

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success
- [ ] Native deep crawling method implemented
- [ ] Fallback to manual method works
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Environment variables configured

### Phase 2 Success
- [ ] Native method works with Azure backend
